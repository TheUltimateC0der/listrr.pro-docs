# Extensive filters

Extensive filters are for users that want to create a lists that are perfectly tailored to their needs.

With complete freedom to group your filters, and connect the groups with logical-operators[^1] of your choosing, you can basically build anything your heart could ever desire.

## Limitations
Since you can decide how your filters get grouped and connected logically, there are no limitations whatsoever. You can also choose the operator[^2] on field level.

That way you got the most freedom you can get for creating your list.

[^1]: You can use `AND`, `OR` as logical operators to connect your filters
[^2]: Available operators are: `equal`, `not_equal`, `less`, `less_or_equal`, `greater`, `greater_or_equal`, `begins_with`, `not_begins_with`, `is_null`, `is_not_null`
