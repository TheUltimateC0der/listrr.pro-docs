!!! warning "Support for trakt.tv as a list provider has been dropped"

    Since trakt decided to get rid of big lists, listrr.pro decided to drop support for list creation on trakt. You can read more of the announcement from trakt.tv [here](https://github.com/trakt/api-help/discussions/350){:target="_blank"}.
    
    You will still be able to import your lists into [Sonarr](/services/sonarr) and [Radarr](/services/radarr). If you used your trakt lists with another tool, we encourage you to contact us, so we can implement listrr.pro into this tool.

# Trakt

The list provider trakt.tv is used to populate your list of created items (shows or movies).

Trakt as a list provider is supported by a lot of scripts and programs to further work with these lists for your ultimate mediaserver experience.
