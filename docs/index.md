# Welcome to the listrr.pro Documentation

### What is it ?

The best tool to create personalized lists for shows and movies with an absurd amount of filters available, for your ultimate PLEX server setup!

With listrr.pro you can create your own lists for movies and tv shows by using a wide variety of filters. The created lists get updated automatically, based on your filters. listrr.pro will add all new items that match your filters, and will also remove all items that do not match your filter configuration anymore.

The project is community driven! Discuss your feature request with the community to make it even better, or tell us about the weird bug you found so we can fix it!
