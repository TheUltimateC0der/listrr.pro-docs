# Privacy policy

## Preamble
listrr.pro strives to be privacy-first.
As such, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) represents many steps we were already taking.
We do not sell personal data we process, or use it for any purpose other than delivering our services.
In addition, we let people access, and delete their personal information, and give our users control over the information passing through our network.

## Cookies
We do not use any advertising cookies.

Our purpose of setting cookies in your browser is to provide our services to you.

We also use Cloudflare to protect against attacks, and get general statistics.

## Further actions to protect your privacy
As one of the keys to be as privacy focused as possible, we minimize the data we store from you. This minimizes the data an attacker can get when for example a database breach happens.

To store as few data as possible we use OAuth with external services you probably already have an existing account, and ask you to authenticate with this account. Therefore we do not store any kind of password or email address. When authenticating with one of the providers we implemented, we also ask for the minimal permission.

The following will show how we use the data from each external service when you connect your account with it.

### Delete your data
Being able to delete your data is one of the main things to protect privacy. Thefore you can at any given time delete ALL data in your account. This action is irreversible, so use it with caution. You can delete your data at any time by follwing this link: [https://listrr.pro/Identity/Account/Manage/DeletePersonalData](https://listrr.pro/Identity/Account/Manage/DeletePersonalData){:target="_blank"}
