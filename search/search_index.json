As such, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) represents many steps we were already taking. We do not sell personal data we process, or use it for any purpose other than delivering our services. In addition, we let people access, and delete their personal information, and give our users control over the information passing through our network. Cookies We do not use any advertising cookies. Our purpose of setting cookies in your browser is to provide our services to you. We also use Cloudflare to protect against attacks, and get general statistics. Further actions to protect your privacy As one of the keys to be as privacy focused as possible, we minimize the data we store from you. This minimizes the data an attacker can get when for example a database breach happens. To store as few data as possible we use OAuth with external services you probably already have an existing account, and ask you to authenticate with this account. Therefore we do not store any kind of password or email address. When authenticating with one of the providers we implemented, we also ask for the minimal permission. The following will show how we use the data from each external service when you connect your account with it. Delete your data Being able to delete your data is one of the main things to protect privacy. Thefore you can at any given time delete ALL data in your account. This action is irreversible, so use it with caution.

We use the access token for your trakt.tv user account to create/update/delete lists on your trakt.tv account that are connected to listrr.pro The refresh token for your trakt.tv user account to get a new access token before it expires We use the expiration date of the access and refresh token to aquire a new set of access and refresh token before it expires Github.com What we store: The username of your Github.com user account The Id of your Github.com user account How do we use this data: We use the username of your Github.com user account as a username of your listrr.pro account, only if you create your account with this provider. Otherwise this gets ignored. We use the the Id of your Github.com user account to match it against all Github.com account Ids that donated on Github.com.

If you are not interested to read all that text, find out about the new features here . listrr.pro v2 has been in the works the last few months, and I have come to a point where I can announce it officially with confidence. A lot has happend over the last year, and I haven\u00b4t had any time to work on listrr.pro v2. It\u00b4s been a hectic year. Not all things have settled yet, but I currently had some time to do the work. All the new features A FUCKTON of new filters There will be a lot more filters available with v2. Finally ... Streaming providers for both, movies and shows. But wait, there is more! For a complete list of all new filters, check here ! AND & OR operators listrr.pro currently has the problem, that the user is locked when it comes to the way filters are linked to each other. The user is not able to choose if a filter should be linked by AND or OR operator. Grouping of filters Grouping of filters, is also a functionality that is not available in the current version of listrr.pro. Grouping in combination with AND or OR operators allows users to have more fine grained control over their filters. Multiple use of filters Using the same property to filter multiple times, but with different values to filter gives the user more control over the result. For example you can now search for a single year, multiple years, a single span of years, or multiple spans of years. Thats not enough for you? We got you covered! You can also search for a single year, multiple years, a single span of years, and a multiple spans of years all together! More planned changes for the future Implementing a basic API for things like #133 Integrating Patreon as donation platform Implementing notifications (Discord, Telegram, $Messenger) Integrating a discord bot to automatically elevate donors to their specific roles Adding the ability to generate a list specific link to utilize the \"Custom List\" feature of radarr Adding the \"Custom List\" feature from radarr to sonarr to be able to import lists directly from listrr.pro into sonarr/radarr Adding the ability for users to directly fork a listrr.pro list inside listrr #78 Adding the ability for users to directly filter a listrr.pro list inside listrr #80 Whats new?

Mainly this was caused by using filter groups. The problem is solved, and all lists have been updated accordingly.

These lists are prefiltered, and come from external sources like IMDb, TMDb, Trakt or other metadata providers. Some of these lists are even genrated by listrr.pro. They are updated regularly, so they always contain the latest content from their source. Some of these lists are completely dynamic. Include external lists All the lists selected will be used for further filtering. So the filters you apply, ONLY apply to the content that is present in these lists. Exclude external lists The items in these lists will be excluded from your list. What does dynamic mean? Dynamic means, these lists are valid for the current year/month/week. So the content is always for the current year/month/week, and gets updated accordingly. Why use dynamic lists? They are there to make your life a lot easier. Example 1 You want to create a list that matches the new released movies each month. Without External lists, you would either create a seperate list for each month, or you would create one list, and edit it every month to match the current month. If you use the This month - New released movies external list, you simply have to create a single list. This list will always match the current months released movies. Example 2 You want to create a list that matches the IMDB: Top Rated TV Shows and filter only for Gerne - Name = Action .

Each block has a seperate purpose. The purpose of each block is explained below. Sonarr Instance # This is your Sonarr instance setting - SonarrInstance__Url=https://sonarr.mydomain.tld - SonarrInstance__ApiKey=YOUR-SONARR-API-KEY These setting are used to talk to your Sonarr instance. The SonarrInstance__Url setting tells the Sonarr bridge where your Sonarr instance can be found. This setting is typically what you type in your browser to reach your Sonarr instance. The SonarrInstance__ApiKey is used to authenticate against the API of your Sonarr instance. You can get this from https://sonarr.mydomain.tld/settings/general AutoImport # This is for automatically importing your own lists from your listrr.pro V2 account - listrr__AutoImport__ImportLists=true - listrr__AutoImport__ApiKey=YOUR-LISTRR-PRO-V2-API-KEY - listrr__AutoImport__QualityProfileId=1 - listrr__AutoImport__RootFolderId=1 - listrr__AutoImport__LanguageProfileId=1 - listrr__AutoImport__Monitored=true - listrr__AutoImport__SearchForMissingEpisodes=true - listrr__AutoImport__SearchForCutoffUnmetEpisodes=true - listrr__AutoImport__SeasonFolder=true - listrr__AutoImport__Tags__0=1 - listrr__AutoImport__Tags__1=5 These settings are important, if you want to import ALL Show lists from your listrr.pro account. listrr__AutoImport__ImportLists is the setting you use to enable ( true ) or disable ( false ) the automatic import of ALL lists into your Sonarr instance. listrr__AutoImport__ApiKey is used to authenticate against the listrr.pro API. That way the listrr.pro API knows which account requests stuff. listrr__AutoImport__QualityProfileId is used to set everything that is imported to a specific Quality Profile. listrr__AutoImport__RootFolderId is used to set everything that is imported to a specific Root folder. listrr__AutoImport__LanguageProfileId is used to set everything that is imported to a specific Language profile. listrr__AutoImport__Monitored is used to tell your Sonarr instance if a show gets added as monitored ( true ) or unmonitored ( false ). listrr__AutoImport__SearchForMissingEpisodes is used to tell if your Sonarr instance should search ( true ) for episodes when the Sonarr bridge adds a show or not ( false ). listrr__AutoImport__SearchForCutoffUnmetEpisodes is used to tell your Sonarr instance to search for Cutoff unmet ( true ) or not ( false ). listrr__AutoImport__SeasonFolder is used to tell your Sonarr instance to create a folder for each season ( true ) or not ( false ). listrr__AutoImport__Tags__0 is used to add Tags to a show when adding it to your Sonarr instance. Be aware to bump the number for each Tag you add. Import a list by ID # This is for importing listrr.pro V2 lists by their Ids - listrr__Lists__0__Id=A-LISTRR-V2-LIST-ID - listrr__Lists__0__QualityProfileId=1 - listrr__Lists__0__RootFolderId=1 - listrr__Lists__0__LanguageProfileId=1 - listrr__Lists__0__Monitored=true - listrr__Lists__0__SearchForMissingEpisodes=true - listrr__Lists__0__SearchForCutoffUnmetEpisodes=true - listrr__Lists__0__SeasonFolders=true - listrr__Lists__0__Tags__0=1 - listrr__Lists__0__Tags__1=35 - listrr__Lists__0__Tags__2=50 This will allow you to import a single list by the ID you get from listrr.pro. You can take a look for existing lists at https://listrr.pro/Home/Lists . Hit the share button to copy the ID of a list. For each list, you have to bump the number Lists__0__ . So if you have 2 lists, you start with Lists__0__ for the first list, and Lists__1__ for your second list, and so on. listrr__Lists__0__Id is used to tell the Sonarr bridge the ID of your list. For example: 6374d7332d52d9b21fd91f86 listrr__Lists__0__QualityProfileId is used to set everything that is imported to a specific Quality Profile. listrr__Lists__0__RootFolderId is used to set everything that is imported to a specific Root folder. listrr__Lists__0__LanguageProfileId is used to set everything that is imported to a specific Language profile. listrr__Lists__0__Monitored is used to tell your Sonarr instance if a show gets added as monitored ( true ) or unmonitored ( false ). listrr__Lists__0__SearchForMissingEpisodes is used to tell if your Sonarr instance should search ( true ) for episodes when the Sonarr bridge adds a show or not ( false ). listrr__Lists__0__SearchForCutoffUnmetEpisodes is used to tell your Sonarr instance to search for Cutoff unmet ( true ) or not ( false ). listrr__Lists__0__SeasonFolders is used to tell your Sonarr instance to create a folder for each season ( true ) or not ( false ). listrr__Lists__0__Tags__0 is used to add Tags to a show when adding it to your Sonarr instance. Be aware to bump the number for each Tag you add. How to run your Sonarr Bridge ? First Run Copy the content of the example docker-compose.yml and save it in the directory you created earlier.
